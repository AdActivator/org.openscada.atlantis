<sect3><title>Installation of administrative Tools</title>
	<note><para>
	The installation of the administrative tools is currently only supported on RPM based systems
	like <trademark>RedHat Enterprise Linux</trademark>. Of course we want to expand this to other
	operating systems and distributions, but at the moment our focus is in <acronym>RHEL</acronym>.
	</para>
	<para>
	It still is possible to install <trademark>OpenSCADA</trademark> on other system. It only is
	more work to do. 
	</para></note>
	
	<para>
	First copy the RPMs to the target system and install them using:
	</para>
	
	<para>
	<screen>
	<prompt>#</prompt> rpm -Uvh *.rpm
	</screen>
	</para>
</sect3>

<sect3><title>Create a P2 base installation</title>
	<para>
	It is now required to create a base server installation. This will install the
	<trademark>OSGi</trademark> container but will not install much functionality
	inside the container.
	</para>
	<para>
	The location of the installation might be of interest to you or your system
	administrator. So it should be chosen carefully as is not recommended to be
	moved.
	</para>
	<para>
	Create the P2 base installation by issuing the following command:
	</para>
	
	<screen>
	<prompt>$</prompt> p2.create "targetDirectory"
	</screen>
	
	<para>
	This will create a new directory named <filename>targetDirectory</filename>
	and install the basic <trademark>OSGi</trademark> container. The command will
	fail if the directory already exists or the base path does not exist.
	</para>
	
	<para>
	Next the basic <trademark>Equinox</trademark> infrastructure is installed:
	</para>
	
	<screen>
	<prompt>$ p2.init "targetDirectory"</prompt>
	</screen>
	
	<note><para>
	At this point it might be a good idea to edit the <filename>launcher.ini</filename>
	file and add necessary arguments before continuing with the installation.
	</para></note>
</sect3>

<sect3><title>Deploying the <trademark>OpenSCADA</trademark> artifacts</title>
	<para>
	The next step is to deploy the <trademark>OpenSCADA</trademark> bundles and features
	to the previously created P2 installation. Depending on the functionality you want to
	have in your server the selection of bundles or features might differ. If you just
	want <quote>it all in</quote> you can install the <acronym>IU</acronym>
	<filename>org.openscada.deploy.feature.group</filename> 
	</para>
